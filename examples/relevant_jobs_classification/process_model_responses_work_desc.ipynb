Our focus is on companies that have high growth prospects backed by cheaper valuations. Not always get investable companies at cheaper valuations but for those, the growth should outperform by a greater extent to give better IRRs. Our investment is long-term in nature unless the stock outperforms are required expectations. Once the companies are selected from our Screeners they flow into our Target companies and from there they only go to the investment stage if the companys growth prospects meet our investment philosophy and should also have good IRRs. We usually try to meet the management to understand their philosophy and their future actions which help us make our decisions. The models are being made for each company well before we meet the management. We monitor our investment by regularly attended the quarterly con-calls and analyst meets of the companies in our portfolio, their peers. Post Covid we started a new vertical on the quantitative side of the markets where we choose stocks that have underperformed their mean/median long term valuations, and make short-term investments majorly in large-cap companies and the basis are strong fundamentals which have cheap valuations either due to turbulent market conditions or due to some headwinds, for this we follow several technical parameters as well which indicate long-term reversals for such stocks.
